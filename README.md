![TESTNET In Operation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/317/40411678-465103e0-5e9b-11e8-8ac0-84538920aabe.png)

This repo is for setting up testnets. Dedicated testnets let us fully test various changes that the --testnet flag doesn't let us test.

Each branch of this repo is a testnet, on each branch the README.md should explain what it is about.  
This master branch will be kept in sync with upstream master turtlecoin/turtlecoin and testnets can be created from master:  
> git checkout -b new-testnet

Note that there are missing params that need to be filled in, this is on purpose to avoid accidentally joining the testnet to mainnet.
